# Project 1: Analysing data with Python 3 and Microsoft Excel  

## Introduction <br>
This projects was design to facilitate learning activities. It focuses on utilising basic programming techniques to implement input, output, control flow, GUI development and finally integrating Python 3 and Microsoft Excel.

## Stages <br>
1. *Generation of data*<br>
This part of the project focuses on generating some sample data that will be manipulated at a later stage.

2. *Creation of a basic GUI* <br>
This section of the project will be used to explore the Tkinter module to create a basic GUI.

3. *An introduction to Python 3 and Microsoft Excel* <br>
This final block of the project will be an introduction to manipulating data in Python 3 and exporting the output on to Microsoft Excel.

## Tools and programming languages <br>
1. Python 3
2. Microsoft Excel

## Documentation (based on Unified Modeling Language) <br>
