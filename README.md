# Purpose <br>
This portfolio has been set up to hold a few personal projects to help me learn Python 3 and web technoligies. I am interested in replacing VBA Excel with Python to obtain, manipulate, analyse and report information and to learn skill that will help me to automate processes.

## Learning outcomes
- Learning the basic programming techniques of Python 3
- Becoming familiar with some of the style guidelines set on PEP 8
- Learning the basic concepts to develop a GUI on Python 3
- Learning the basics of generating, manipulating and exporting data to Microsoft Excel using Python 3

### Projects
#### Project 1 - Random Data Generation
- **Project 1A: Data generation with Python 3 and Microsoft Excel**   
This project will focus on generating random data given a set of lists that provide some basic categories. Basic Python techniques such as input, print and control flow will be used. The output will be stored in different file formats. It will be used to learn how to create a simple GUI on Python 3 by using TKinter and it will act as an introduction to data analysis in Python 3 and how to report that outcome on Microsoft Excel. <br> **[Additional information](https://github.com/jmoracalzas/my-portfolio/blob/master/Project_1/README.md)**

- ** Project 1B: Data generation using web technologies**
This is the implementetion of the same project but using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
