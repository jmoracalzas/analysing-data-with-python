# Purpose
This portfolio has been set up to hold a few personal Python projects to help me learn Python 3. I am interested in replacing VBA Excel with Python to obtain, manipulate, analyse and report information.

## Learning outcomes
- Learning the basic programming techniques of Python 3
- Becoming familiar with some of the style guidelines set on PEP 8
- Learning the basic concepts to develop a GUI on Python 3
- Learning to generate, manipulate, analyse and report data on Microsoft Excel using Python 3

### Projects
- **Project 1: Analysis of data with Python 3 and Microsoft Excel**   
This project will focus on generating random data given a set of lists that provide some basic categories. Basic Python techniques such as input, print and control flow will be used. This input will be stored in a text file. It will be used to learn how to create a simple GUI on Python 3 by using TKinter and it will act as an introduction to data analysis in Python 3 and how to report that outcome on Microsoft Excel.
