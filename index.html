        <h2>Why did I create this website?</h2>
        <p>This website has been developed to host different small project to asssit me developing programming skills. I
            have used VBA Excel to automate spreadsheets in the past. After a few years of learning the basics of C#,
            HTML, CSS I decided to focus my attention on learning Python to automate any spreadsheets I use in the
            office.
            This website will incorporate some examples that I used to learn specific topics such as OpenPyXl to
            interact with a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet from Python and other basic projct used to learn these
            technologies. The current focus is on learning Python, SQL and web technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).
        </p>
        <p>The code used in these examples is stored in my personal GitHub repository and can be accessed by anyone
            accordingly.</p>

        <h2>Why these technologies?</h2>
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>Python is a programming laungage that is easy to learn and that is having an significant impact on businesses
            and finance departments. There is an interest in using Python for automation and data analysis.</p>

        <h3>Web technologies</h3>
        <p>I used user forms in VBA Excel to create custom user interfaces on Microsoft Excel. The current trends in
            technology have highglighted how beneficial online systems are. As a result, I am learning web technologies
            to replace desktop user interfaces with web frontends.</p>

        <h3>SQL and other types of accessing data</h3>
        <p>This section will concentrate in bringing SQL and data access to these languages. The aim would be to connect
            to a data source, extract information and manipulate that data.
        </p>

        <p>This section will provide additional resource for specific topics. You can find some online learning
            materials below to become familiar with Python, HTML and CSS.</p>
