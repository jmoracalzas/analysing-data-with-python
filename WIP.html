    <h2>Why did I create this portfolio?</h2>
    <p>As a finance professional, I have used several techniques to bring, manipulate, analyse and report data on
        Microsoft Excel. All those techniques accomplished the task at hand however, they were not the most
        efficient way of completing activities as they would normally include a considerable amount of repetition.
        Some of the techniques I used include <em>VBA Excel (macro programming)</em> and <em>SQL</em> queries
        against CSV files to obtain and transform data. The rise of cloud computing and machine learning is reshaping
        all industries and finance (accounting especifically) is not an exception. This trend has forced me to
        reconsider the approach I was taking towards technological change and its effect on how efficient the practices
        I follow at work were.</p>
    <p>I have created this small portfolio to hlep me leave spreadsheets behind by learning programming languages to
        prepare, analyse and report financial information and to automate tasks to bring efficiencies to my workplace.
    </p>
    <h2>Programming languages</h2>
    <p>I will concentrate on learning the following programming languages so I can develop web applications and desktop
        solutions.</p>
